## üéØ Overview

Echo is designed to make your neighborhood feel closer.  
Posts are tailored to your location, ensuring discussions are relevant to where you are and what‚Äôs happening around you.  
Whether you‚Äôre sharing an event, reporting an alert, or highlighting a hidden gem, Echo brings together people who are geographically close ‚Äî encouraging engagement that matters.  

The app features real-time updates, tag-based filtering, and interactive Points of Interest (POIs) such as colleges, landmarks, and parks that serve as gathering points for discussion.  
Built using **clean architecture** and **Firebase-powered infrastructure**, Echo prioritizes speed, scalability, and a frictionless user experience.
